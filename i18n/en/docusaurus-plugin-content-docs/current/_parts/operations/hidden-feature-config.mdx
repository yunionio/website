## Hidden Feature Configuration

### Introduction

Cloudpods has been under development since 2017, with a long accumulation period. However, the codebase is large, with many features, and some code has not been iteratively maintained for a long time. Therefore, in the community free version frontend, we selectively hide some features that have the following characteristics:

1. Not mature enough;
2. Lack of maintenance;
3. Rarely used;
4. Feature components that are complex and difficult to understand and use;

This reduces maintenance and support costs while improving the user experience.

The code for hidden features is still maintained in the open source project repository.

Based on these reasons, starting from v3.8.7, we have gradually hidden some features. If users need these features, they can choose the following ways to enable them:

1. Submit an issue to request enabling this feature;
2. Some features can be enabled via climc;
3. Fork your own frontend version and enable this feature.

### Enable Hidden Feature Using climc

For example, in version 3.9, we hide k8s container cluster management, JD Cloud public cloud management, and other features by default; we enable commonly used Alibaba Cloud, AWS, and other public cloud management features by default. Users can enable or disable corresponding features according to their needs using the climc command-line tool.

#### Example

```bash
# View all supported features
$ climc --help | grep feature-config
```

The format and parameters of the subcommand are as follows:

```bash
$ climc feature-config-$feature --switch {on|off}
# $feature: represents the specific feature name, such as: k8s, s3, jdcloud, etc.
# on: means enable
# off: means disable
```

For example, the command to enable/disable k8s container cluster management feature is:

```bash
# Enable
$ climc feature-config-k8s --switch on

# Disable
$ climc feature-config-k8s --switch off
```

For example, the command to enable/disable JD Cloud management feature is:

```bash
# Enable
$ climc feature-config-jdcloud --switch on

# Disable
$ climc feature-config-jdcloud --switch off
```

- [CHANGELOG v3.11.10](../development/changelog/release-3_11/3-11-10)

## v3.11.9

date: 2024-12-24

## v3.11.0

Version 3.11 started development in April 2023, taking about 10 months, with more than 4000 PRs.

1. Open Source Summer 2023

Thanks to four students from Open Source Summer 2023 for contributing the following features to Cloudpods v3.11:

- VM Emergency Mode: Allows booting VMs into a temporary in-memory Linux system. When VM kernel files are corrupted, rootfs file system failures occur, etc., and users cannot normally start VMs, they can restart VMs to enter emergency mode, view VM file systems, locate problems, backup data, and repair problems when possible. [@IRONICBo](https://github.com/IRONICBo)
- Support Volcano Engine: Support Volcano Engine resource management, and Enterprise Edition also supports managing and analyzing Volcano Engine bills. [@LyndonKong](https://github.com/LyndonKong)
- Support deploying Ubuntu 22.03 (already backported to 3.10 and released) [@niconical](https://github.com/niconical)
- Support changing KVM VM NIC configuration via QGA (already backported to 3.10 and released) [@chentianxiang](https://github.com/62374520)

2. Host Improvements

Host functionality in v3.11 has many improvements, focusing on two directions: First, private cloud hosts more fully utilize hardware performance; Second, improve cloud host usability.

To fully utilize hardware performance, Cloudpods already supports many features, including PCI device passthrough (including NICs, GPUs, NVMe devices, etc.), NIC SR-IOV and ovs offload, enabling host huge pages, binding virtual CPU cores to physical cores, etc. In v3.11, Cloudpods implemented the long-awaited VM NUMA-aware memory allocation strategy. After enabling, it tries to allocate a VM's memory within the same NUMA node's memory space, and the VM's vCPUs are also allocated to the same NUMA node as much as possible, avoiding performance degradation caused by cross-NUMA allocation of VM CPUs and memory.

Another important feature is support for using LVM to manage shared block storage (SAN storage). Shared block storage uses LVM management, VMs directly mount logical volumes (LV) allocated from shared block storage, eliminating file system overhead introduced by using files as virtual disks. Cloudpods supports clvm and slvm two shared LVM management methods. Simply put, clvm mode uses cluster-mode clvm service to manage LVM volumes on shared network storage, clvm automatically provides distributed high availability for lvm management service. But the disadvantage is clvm configuration is complex. slvm does not require configuring complex cluster clvm service, each host node only needs to install single-machine lvm service, platform selects one node as shared storage's lvm configuration node, platform automatically refreshes lvm metadata on nodes that need to mount after allocating LV on that node, obtaining allocated LV. This method avoids the complexity of deploying distributed clvm. But after the configuration node becomes unavailable, manual switching of configuration node is needed. But this issue can be gradually solved in later iterations.

In addition, Cloudpods also has preliminary support for vGPU, including Nvidia and AMD's virtualized vGPU.

In improving host usability, the following work was done: 1) Supported emergency mode for built-in private cloud KVM VMs, allowing users to diagnose and repair VMs that cannot start through a temporary operating system. 2) Support logging into Windows VMs via WebRDP protocol. The advantage of using RDP protocol is that it can automatically passwordlessly log into Windows VMs and supports clipboard, better usability. 3) Full support for userdata, allowing users to set scripts to execute after host initial startup when applying for hosts, making host application process more convenient. 4) Support migrating managed Cloudpods cluster KVM VMs to built-in private cloud, users can use this function to consolidate multiple Cloudpods private clouds.

Finally, in host networking, IPv6 support is an important function introduced in v3.11, supporting IPv6 address management and assigning IPv6 addresses to hosts.

Another important network improvement is VMware adopting a new Layer 2 network model, each VMware network port group corresponds to a Cloudpods Layer 2 network. This way VMware users can intuitively see VMware vCenter port groups on the platform, easier to understand and configure corresponding Layer 2 network IP subnets. But users who used VMware before v3.11 will be affected by this change after upgrading to 3.11. After upgrade, need to reconfigure VMware IP subnets, change IP subnet's Layer 2 network to the Layer 2 network corresponding to its VMware port group.

3. Multi-Cloud Iteration

Multi-cloud functionality continues to iterate in v3.11. Besides adding Volcano Engine and Kingsoft Cloud public cloud platforms, the most important update is refactoring the configuration information management model.

We once invented a multi-cloud scenario configuration information management model, using one-to-many mapping relationships, i.e., platform maintains one configuration data, this configuration corresponds to multiple configurations on various cloud platforms. The most common is security group configuration. Platform maintains one security group configuration, this security group corresponds to security groups with the same configuration on various cloud platforms, various accounts, various regions. For example, if a user defines a security group allowing access to TCP port 22, then security groups allowing access to TCP 22 under various VPCs in various regions under various cloud accounts on various cloud platforms for this user are all associated with this security group, platform maintains mapping relationships between cloud security groups and local security groups through security group cache data structures. At design time, we expected this configuration management method to improve usability of using multi-cloud configurations, i.e., users don't need to care whether this configuration is maintained on cloud, just select local security group, platform will automatically synchronize local security group to cloud, or find a corresponding security group on cloud. But in actual use, users were confused by this configuration maintenance method, local and cloud configurations easily became inconsistent, and security group changes caused user host network failures multiple times. Although previous versions made many improvements and restrictions, avoiding some problems, overall effect was not good. Therefore, starting from v3.11, we abandoned this one-to-many configuration maintenance model, changed all configuration information maintenance to one-to-one mapping model. Affected configuration information includes: security groups, DNS records, automatic snapshot policies, load balancer SSL certificates, load balancer access control.

4. FinOps

2023 was a year of rapid FinOps development. Cloudpods Enterprise Edition's FinOps functionality has significant improvements, mainly in the following aspects:

Cost Allocation: v3.11 Enterprise Edition did a lot of work in cost allocation, supporting complex cost allocation strategies. Including allocating bill costs to local projects based on cloud projects or labels, allocating prepaid (including CPP) resource costs to months within the period, and supporting allocating shared costs to specified projects according to equal allocation or proportional allocation strategies.

Cost Analysis: v3.11 Enterprise Edition cost analysis capabilities are stronger, on one hand functionality is more powerful, can filter, aggregate and generate reports on costs based on bill labels, project labels, resource labels and other multi-dimensional labels. On the other hand, query performance is faster, through joint queries of configuration data stored in MySQL and transaction bill data stored in ClickHouse, making queries both fast and accurate.

Cost Prediction: Based on multiple linear regression model to achieve prediction of fine-grained dimension cost data such as project+account+resource type+billing method, support users inputting regression model parameters to adjust prediction data, support multi-dimensional analysis queries on prediction data.

Billing Strategy: Support rate sets, can set different rates for different projects, domains or organizational structures, support setting billing time granularity of year, month, day, hour, second, support fixed price, pay-as-you-go and tiered pricing methods.

Also worth mentioning is support for container billing. Platform automatically collects resource usage of pods in configured container clusters, including CPU, memory and PVC space quotas allocated to pods, for billing.

5. Installation and Deployment

Cloudpods v3.11 adapted to more operating systems. Besides CentOS 7, Debian 10, 11, Ubuntu 22.04 already supported in previous versions, also adapted to a series of operating systems corresponding to CentOS 8, including: AnolisOS 8.8, OpenCloudOS 8.8, RockyLinux 8.9, AlmaLinux 8.9, etc. Also adapted openEuler 22.03 LTS SP3 to address domestic innovation scenarios. All above systems can use ocboot for online deployment.

At the same time, for commercial version offline deployment scenarios, with CentOS 7 EOL in June 2024, v3.11 no longer uses CentOS 7.9 as the main offline deployment operating system, but adopts openEuler 22.03 LTS SP3.

6. Others

Starting from v3.11, default monitoring storage changed to VictoriaMetrics, further improving monitoring data query speed.

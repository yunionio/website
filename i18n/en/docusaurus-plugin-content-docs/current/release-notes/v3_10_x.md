## v3.10.10 (including v3.10.9)

date: 2023-12-26

This release is the last minor version release of 3.10 in 2023 (version 3.10.9 was skipped due to testing reasons). It mainly addresses lightweight VM deployment mode issues and VictoriaMetrics monitoring issues that were reported after the 3.10.8 release, including:

1. Lightweight VM deployment mode could not deploy VMs using local storage outside the /opt/cloud directory
2. Reduced lightweight VM memory usage from 1G to 256MB, increased deployment concurrency per host from 2 to 5, improving deployment efficiency
3. docker-compose installation mode also supports lightweight VM deployment mechanism, supporting initialization of managed VMware disks
4. Provided VM deployment mechanism documentation https://www.cloudpods.org/docs/guides/onpremise/host/host-deployer
5. Fixed issues such as failure to create alert policies using VictoriaMetrics and queries for long time ranges not taking effect

In addition, the documentation site will officially switch to v2. At that time, https://www.cloudpods.org will directly access v2 documentation, and the old documentation can be accessed via https://v1.cloudpods.org.

### Feature Enhancements (Enhancements)

- 【Host】Reduced lightweight VM memory usage to 256MB
- 【Deployment】Support deploying and managing VMware based on docker-compose
- 【Bare Metal】Support grub using tftp to download boot kernel and initrd

### CHANGELOG

For specific changes, please refer to: 

- [CHANGELOG v3.10.10](../development/changelog/release-3_10/3-10-10)
- [CHANGELOG v3.10.9](../development/changelog/release-3_10/3-10-9)

This release is the last minor version release of 3.10 in 2023. Early next year will see the release of 3.11, which will be the last minor version of 3.0 and will be maintained long-term as Cloudpods' first LTS version. After that, we will enter the 4.0 era.

## v3.10.8

date: 2023-12-08

This release is the most important minor version release since 3.10, containing three major updates.

1. VM deployment method changed to lightweight VM mode. When deploying VMs in local private cloud, lightweight VMs are started to mount VM disks, achieving OS identification and configuration file initialization for VM disks. Compared to the original method of mounting VM disks through host nbd kernel module for deployment, this eliminates dependence on host kernel, solves LVM resource conflicts in host environment, and significantly improves VM deployment reliability.
2. Replaced default monitoring storage from Influxdb to VictoriaMetrics, which has better performance in response speed and storage space.
3. Support migrating managed Cloudpods VMs to built-in private cloud platform, facilitating consolidation of multiple Cloudpods clusters.

At the same time, we upgraded the documentation foundation framework and migrated documentation to the more modern docusaurus for building. The new version of documentation can already be previewed at [https://v2.cloudpods.org](https://v2.cloudpods.org). After the new documentation content is complete, the Cloudpods documentation site URL will be switched to the new version.

### Feature Enhancements (Enhancements)

- 【Host】Replaced nbd mount deployment method with lightweight VM method
- 【Host】Optimized VM image sorting and filtering
- 【Multi-Cloud】Cloud account read-only mode supports one-way resource label synchronization
- 【Multi-Cloud】Zstack supports synchronizing shared storage
- 【Multi-Cloud】PVE platform VMs support opening VNC

### Bug Fixes (Fixes)

- 【Host】Fixed host list export failure issue
- 【Host】Fixed host-agent panic issue during primary-standby host switching
- 【Host】Fixed SR-IOV NIC hot-plug failure issue
- 【Host】Fixed inaccurate SR-IOV NIC monitoring data acquisition issue

### New Features (New Features)

- 【Host】Support migrating managed Cloudpods hosts to local
- 【Monitoring】Support using VictoriaMetrics as monitoring backend

:::tip
- To avoid service interruption caused by upgrade, v3.10.8 will only deploy VictoriaMetrics by default, but not enable it by default. Please refer to: [Manually Migrate from Influxdb to VictoriaMetrics](../../onpremise/operations/monitoring/migrating-to-vm). Starting from 3.11, VictoriaMetrics will be enabled by default.
- VM deployment method uses lightweight VM method by default, but the original nbd-based VM deployment method is still retained and can be switched back by modifying configuration.

## v3.10.7

date: 2023-11-08

This release focuses on optimization and fixes of existing features. This release focuses on integrating the new version of China Telecom Cloud that received more community feedback.

This release has switched to the latest version of China Telecom Cloud interfaces, making it more convenient to use.

At the same time, this release optimized deployment, newly supporting deployment based on Ubuntu 22.04 distribution. The deployment script has also been differentiated according to user usage scenarios, supporting three deployment methods: virt (private cloud), cmp (multi-cloud management), and full (converged cloud).

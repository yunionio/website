## Web Interface Menu Switch

:::tip
Starting from version 3.9, the Web interface only displays commonly used stable function interfaces by default. Container management is used less frequently, so this function is hidden by default. The Web interface will not display it. If you need to display this function menu, use the following command line to turn it on or off:
:::

```bash
# Enable k8s container cluster management menu
$ climc feature-config-k8s --switch on

# Disable k8s container cluster management menu
$ climc feature-config-k8s --switch off
```

# Authentication System

Introduces Keystone's authentication system concepts and operations.

The Keystone authentication system consists of *authentication sources*, *users*, and *groups*.

Name   | Resource               | Description                   | Domain Resource | Notes
-------|--------------------|------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------
Authentication Source | identity_providers	| Defines the source of user and group information | No | Authentication sources are independent of domains. Authentication sources can provide user authentication information to one or more domains
User   | users              | Users are executors of all resource operations. Any operation within the platform needs to be executed as a user. Each service needs a service user. The operator of operations executed by that service is this service user | Yes | Users must belong to a domain
Group     | groups             | Groups are collections of users. Adding a group to a project is equivalent to adding users in the group to the project | Yes | Groups must belong to a domain

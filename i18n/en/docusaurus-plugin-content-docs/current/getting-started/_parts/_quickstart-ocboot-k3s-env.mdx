:::tip Notes:
- The operating system needs to be a clean version, because the deployment tool will build a k3s cluster of the specified version from scratch, so ensure that the system does not have kubernetes, containerd and other container management tools installed, otherwise conflicts will occur causing installation exceptions.
- Minimum configuration requirements: CPU 8 cores, memory 8GiB, storage 200GiB.
- The storage paths for virtual machines and services are all under the **/opt** directory, so ideally it is recommended to set up a separate mount point for the **/opt** directory.
    - For example, partition /dev/sdb1 separately as ext4 and mount it to the /opt directory via /etc/fstab.

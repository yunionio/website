## Introduction

Many users have reported that ocboot's current k8s suite version is too low (`v1.15`) and hope to launch a higher version. For this reason, we have launched a deployment method based on `buildah`+`k3s` (`v1.28`).

::::warning
Please note that this solution is currently in the testing phase. Please fully test it before using it in your production environment.
::::

This installation solution no longer depends on `ansible` on the target machine, but integrates ansible and its dependencies into the `buildah` image.

## Deployment Method

Please use the following command to deploy. Please refer to the comment section.

import BuildahK3S from '@site/src/components/BuildahK3S';

<BuildahK3S productVersion={props.productVersion} />

## Add Nodes

import K3sAddNode from '@site/src/components/K3sAddNode';

<K3sAddNode />

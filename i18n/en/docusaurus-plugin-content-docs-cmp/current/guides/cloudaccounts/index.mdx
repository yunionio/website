# Cloud Account

The cloud management platform establishes connections with different platforms through cloud accounts and synchronizes resources from those platforms to the cloud management platform for management. Resources corresponding to an account belong to a domain, and resources in different domains are isolated. Resources from cloud accounts can be shared with other domains through the sharing feature. When the system does not enable three-level permissions, all cloud resources belong to the default domain by default.

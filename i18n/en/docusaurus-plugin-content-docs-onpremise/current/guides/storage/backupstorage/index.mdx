# Backup Storage

Backup storage is storage for storing virtual machine disk backups, mounted to the platform through external mounting. Currently mainly supports NFS storage.

Disk backup is a backup of a virtual machine disk's snapshot at a certain point in time. Host backup is a collection of disk backups of all disks of a virtual machine.

The method to obtain disk backup is: first snapshot the virtual machine disk, then export the snapshot data as a qcow2 file, which is the disk's backup.

Currently only supports full disk backup.

Both snapshots and backups save the state of virtual machine disks at a certain point in time, and can restore disks at a specified point in time. However, the differences between snapshots and backups are as follows:


|         | Snapshot        | Backup                            |
|---------|------------|---------------------------------|
| Storage Location  | Inside Block Storage  | Independent storage outside block storage, such as NFS or object storage |
| Retention Time  |  Short        | Long                              |
| Recovery Time  | Short         | Long                              |
| Export/Import  | Not Supported      | Supported                            |

# Virtual Machine Domain Name Settings

Virtual machine domain names involve the following services:

* region is responsible for generating virtual machine domain name information
* host is responsible for injecting domain name information into virtual machines through dhcp
* region_dns is responsible for domain name resolution between virtual machines, implementing resolution based on hostname and host IP.

Each virtual machine needs to configure its domain name resolution server and domain name resolution address prefix. These two pieces of information are generated by region, synchronized to host, and finally issued to the virtual machine through dhcp.

region service provides the following two configuration items to specify virtual machine dns server address and search domain suffix

Configuration Option     | Description
-------------|------------------------------------------------------------
dns_server   | Global dns server address, default is the IP of the node where region_dns is located in the cluster 
dns_domain   | Global dns search suffix, default value is cloud.onecloud.io

At the same time, each IP subnet has two attributes, used to override global region configuration options, providing personalized domain name servers and suffixes

Attribute         | Description                                 | Default Value
-------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------
guest_dns    | Domain name resolution server address for virtual machines in this IP subnet | region's dns_server option
guest_domain | Domain name suffix for virtual machines in this IP subnet           | region's dns_domain option
